## Ideas

### Design assumptions:

>- Console application - communication with the user from the console level
>- Data stored in a file on the local file system

### Requirements:

>- Catalog of questions and answers to them
>- Questions can have any number of answers
>- The answer cannot exist without the question
>- The questions are divided into categories
>- Each question must be assigned to exactly one category

### Example:

`Category - Free time`\
`Question - How to spend the evening?`\
`Answer:`
 `1. Watch a movie`
 `2. Go for a walk`
 `3. Learn Java`
